# NYU Classrooms
By Matthew Tessler and Jonathan Philippou

### Accomplished so far:
  * The map displays marker at address associated with building code
  * User can save classes for themselves
  * We have a Dictionary with all of the [NYU Building Codes](http://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/registration-records-and-graduation/registration/classroom-locations.html) (as a hard-coded copy/paste of the JSON file)
  * We scraped all of the [NYU Building Codes](http://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/registration-records-and-graduation/registration/classroom-locations.html) from the web and saved them into a JSON file

### To do:

 * Add sounds, other bells and whistles, increase aesthetics
