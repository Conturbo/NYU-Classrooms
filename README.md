# NYU Classrooms
By Matthew Tessler and Jonathan Philippou

### Accomplished so far:
  * The app maps building code to an address, sends it to the map view where it displays on marker
  * We have a Dictionary with all of the [NYU Building Codes](http://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/registration-records-and-graduation/registration/classroom-locations.html) (as a hard-coded copy/paste of the JSON file)
  * We scraped all of the [NYU Building Codes](http://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/registration-records-and-graduation/registration/classroom-locations.html) from the web and saved them into a JSON file

### To do:

 * Enhance detail of addresses where necessary to make okay for geocoding api
 * Use geocoding api to translate address into lat/long
 * Implement back button with navigation bar
 * Add sounds, other bells and whistles
 
### Stretch Goals:
* The user can save their classes in a table view for easier look-ups
	- For example: the cell may read "iOS Programming" instead of "CIWW"
